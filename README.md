# Question6
# Challenges

I prefer studying during the night when it’s quiet and peaceful than during the day. This is because I find it challenging to fully understand something when there are distractions. Also, should I get into the program I’ll have to move back home where I live with a small family with great needs. Although they will understand that I need my time to build my career, I feel it will be hard to ignore it wen they need my help during the day. Also, rural areas are still experiencing more hours of load shedding which might prevent me from attending fully. 

# Solutions

I will create a schedule and try harder to stick to it. I understand it won’t happen overnight, but I am willing to try new studying strategies. Should I feel that the program’s stipend is enough for me to continue renting away from home, I will stay here for as long as I need to since there is less load-shedding and better reception than in rural areas.
